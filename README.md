# Academic Website

This is for anyone looking to create their own version of this website.


## Getting Started

To get started with your version of this website, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create your copy of this repository.

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/oseiagm.github.io.git
     ```

3. **Open the Project**
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd oseiagm.github.io
     ```

4. **Edit Content**
   - Open `index.html` in your favorite text editor and modify the content to your liking.
   - Update styles in `assets/style.css` to change the appearance. The Barlow font is loaded via a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` of `index.html`; adjust or remove as desired.
   - Replace the existing images in the `assets` folder with your own.

5. **Preview Locally**
   - You can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser to preview your changes.

6. **Push Changes**
   - Once you're satisfied with your edits, commit your changes and push them back to your fork:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Your message here"
     git push origin main
     ```

7. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Navigate to the "Settings" tab, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and select the `main` branch as the source. Save your changes.
   - Your website will be live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`.
